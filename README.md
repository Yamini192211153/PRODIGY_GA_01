# 🎬 Fine-Tuning GPT-2 for Movie Recommendations

## 📌 Internship Task - Prodigy InfoTech (Generative AI Intern)

As part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, I worked on a Generative AI project where I **fine-tuned a pre-trained GPT-2 model on a custom movie dataset** to generate human-like movie recommendations. The task was designed to help me understand how to structure textual data, tokenize it, fine-tune a language model, and generate contextually relevant output based on user preferences.

## 🛠️ Implementation Overview

✅ **Dataset Preparation**  
- Created a simple movie dataset with titles, genres, years, and runtimes.  
- Formatted data into natural language prompts for model training.

✅ **Text Generation for Training**  
- Converted structured movie data into descriptive sentences like:  
  *“I recommend Titanic, a drama and romance movie from 1997.”*

✅ **Model Fine-Tuning**  
- Used HuggingFace’s `GPT2LMHeadModel` and `Trainer` API to fine-tune GPT-2 on custom movie recommendation texts.  
- Implemented tokenization, input preparation, and trained the model for 1 epoch.

✅ **Recommendation System**  
- Developed a simple interface where users can input genre-based queries (e.g., “horror movies”) and receive AI-generated movie suggestions.  
- Cleaned and matched outputs with the original movie dataset for more readable results.
