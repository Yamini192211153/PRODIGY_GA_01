        "# Minimal Movie Recommendation System\n",
        "\n",
        "A streamlined movie recommendation system using GPT-2 for text generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What this system does:\n",
        "1. **Trains** a GPT-2 model on movie data\n",
        "2. **Generates** movie recommendations based on user input\n",
        "3. **Provides** simple search interface for movie preferences\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to search for movies:\n",
        "- **By Genre**: \"action movies\", \"horror films\", \"romantic comedies\"\n",
        "- **By Year**: \"movies from 1990s\", \"films from 2000s\"\n",
        "- **By Style**: \"family-friendly movies\", \"thriller films\", \"animated movies\"\n",
        "- **Combined**: \"action movies from 1990s\", \"romantic comedies for date night\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Best search practices:\n",
        "- Keep it simple: \"comedy movies\" works better than \"extremely funny comedic films\"\n",
        "- Use common genres: action, comedy, drama, horror, romance, sci-fi, thriller\n",
        "- Include time periods: \"1980s\", \"1990s\", \"2000s\"\n",
        "- Be specific: \"horror movies for Halloween\" vs just \"movies\""
